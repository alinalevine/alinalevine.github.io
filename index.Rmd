### About Me

I am a first year masters student in the biostatistics department at Columbia University. I also tutor math for grades 3-12 as well as Spanish. I enjoy photography, playing violin in the New Westchester Symphony Orchestra, and playing tennis. This is a linked to my [resume](alinalevine_cv.html).


This summer I was did a language exchange in Spain and had the opportunity to explore towns and nature in northern Spain. Here are a couple of my favorite pictures from the trip.
